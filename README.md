# Quiz-App_Cesar_Yousef
This History quiz was written by Cesar and Yousef. The app includes five multiple choice questions about historic events in U.S history. We wroked together wireframing which was gathering questions, drawing a rough sketch of the UI, and writting the code. The technologies we used were HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to have it fully functioning. We made sure to try to keep the functions as direct as possible and overcame the challenge of organizing them. As a pair we worked constantly on making sure the JS code was well orangized and communicated any issues we had.
